# Emosion_Detection
This is project base on images where human facial expression images is classified as per the emosion. Person emosion is defferent as per behaviours such as Happy, Sad, Confused, Exited etc. This project is related to the human nature and predict his mood base on facial expression. This dataset is collected from the kaggle.com and analysis the human nature. 

# 1. Problem statement :  
study the human face images in different emosion and predict there emosion as per the facial expression. here main task is to predict the human face emosion base on its facial expression. each and every human has its bahaviour and which is approximate same for all. Base on the facial expression we are going to predict expression such as Happy, Sleepy, Sad, Agressive, etc.

# 2. Data preprocessing : 
convert all images in the fixed size. To convert the data fix resolution or pixel is best way to clean images and helps to analysis the prediction. 
All images in training and testing should have same size. 

# 3. Modelling 
build model in the local machine. its was runs long time with 0.48 accuracy. 
optimize this model in kaggle after connecting GPU and train again with additional layes 

# 4. Evaluation 
check evaluation score of metrics as Accuracy score and validation score and loss. In the local machine it was taken large time to train the model. therefor i used kaggle platform to train the model with GPU. and optimize my model from 0.48 % to 0.79 % 
# 5. Deployment 
finaly developed gui and deploy this model to predict any image. Save model in Json file and used in the another python gui file and observed its results. All files and code are attached in the doccumets.
