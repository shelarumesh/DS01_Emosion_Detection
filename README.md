# Emosion_Detection
This is project base on images where human facial expression images is classified as per the emosion.

# 1. Problem statement :  
study the human face images in different emosion and predict there emosion as per the facial expression

# 2. Data preprocessing : 
convert all images in the fixed size. 

# 3. Modelling 
build model in the local machine. its was runs long time with 0.48 accuracy. 
optimize this model in kaggle after connecting GPU and train again with additional layes 

# 4. Evaluation 
check evaluation score of metrics as Accuracy score and validation score and loss

# 5. Deployment 
finaly developed gui and deploy this model to predict any image
